<h2>Features</h2>
✨ Text Classifier comes with the following features:

📄 Text Classification: Enter plain text along with a label and get instant classification results.
📁 File Upload: Upload text files for batch classification.
🌟 User-Friendly Interface: Built with Gradio for an intuitive and interactive user experience.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

👨‍💻 To get started with Text Classifier, follow these simple steps:
<ol>
<li>
Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/geehaad/LLamaIndex-Text-Classification.git
cd LLamaIndex-Text-Classification
```
<li>
Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
<li>
Start the application (you can run the helper file to get the output in your terminal, or use the interface):

```bash
python helper.py
python prototype/webApp.py
```
<li>
Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:5000. (the linke will appear in your terminal)

</ol>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>🚀 Using the Text Classifier with Gradio is easy and user-friendly. You have two options:</h3>
<h4>Text Classification</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the "Text" tab to classify individual text entries.
<li>Enter the text in the "context" textbox.
<li>Specify how you want to classify it in the "Labels" textbox.

<li>Click "Get Classification" to see the result.
</ol>
<h4>File Classification</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the "Files" tab to classify text from a file.
<li>Upload a text file using the "context" file input.
<li>Specify the classification labels in the "Labels" textbox.
<li>Click "Get Classification" to process the file and view the results.
</ol>

<h3>Helper File (helper.py)</h3>
The helper.py file in the src/components directory contains the essential functions for text classification. It uses OpenAI's GPT model for classification.

<h4>Here's a brief overview of the helper functions:</h4>

<code>analyze_file(file_path, labels): </code>Classifies text from a file based on provided labels.<br>
<code>analyze_text(text, labels): </code>Classifies a single text entry based on provided labels.<br>

<b>To use the helper functions, ensure that your OpenAI API key is set correctly in helper.py.<b>
